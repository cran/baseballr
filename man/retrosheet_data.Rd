\usage{
retrosheet_data(
  path_to_directory = NULL,
  years_to_acquire = most_recent_mlb_season() - 1,
  sequence_years = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_directory}{(default: NULL) A file path that if set, either:
\enumerate{
\item creates a new directory, or
\item uses the path to an existing directory
}}

\item{years_to_acquire}{(format: YYYY) The seasons to collect. Single, multiple, and
sequential years can be passed. If passing multiple years, enclose in a
vector (i.e. c(2017,2018)). Defaults to \code{most_recent_mlb_season()}.}

\item{sequence_years}{(logical, default: FALSE): If the seasons passed in the years_to_acquire parameter
should be sequenced so that the function returns all years including and
between the vector passed, set the argument to TRUE. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
If \code{path_to_directory} is not set (default), the process will return a named list
of tibbles: 'events' and 'rosters' for each season provided to \code{years_to_acquire}
If \code{path_to_directory} is set, will also write two csv files to the unzipped directory: 1) a combined csv
of the event data for a given year and 2) a combined csv of each team's
roster for each year provided to \code{years_to_acquire}

This function requires the use of the \href{https://github.com/chadwickbureau/chadwick/releases}{\strong{\verb{Chadwick CLI}}}. Follow
the directions at the repository for installation of the CLI release for your platform.
Specifically from the \strong{\verb{Chadwick CLI}} tools, this function requires the \strong{\code{cwevent}} application to be available from the command line.
For unix platform users: the \code{retrosheet_data()} function uses the \code{system()} interface under the hood.
For Windows and other platform users: the \code{retrosheet_data()} function interacts with the \strong{\code{cwevent}} application
using the \code{shell()} interface under the hood.
